This project was created as a central repository for common UI components used in our other projects

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run test`

### `npm build-lib`

### importing LtiApplyTheme
when impoting LtiApplyTheme, the default theme is the new theme, so any import that requires the older version would have to have to pass in a version props of 'Old'
